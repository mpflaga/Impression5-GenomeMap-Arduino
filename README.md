A interactive game for children to learn about how plants have migrated through out history across the globe. 

Select anyone of the plants by placing the corresponding tablet on the specified location on the table top. A RFID will identify to the tablet, initializing the sequence by illuminating the place of origin.

Then the user touches the region of next migration, as provided by the clues described on the tablet. Touching a correct region(s) causes the regions(s) to flash green and then draw a line to that region. An incorrect selection will flash red, until the correct region(s) are selected. Upon completion of the migration path the entire path will flash.

There is an idle time out that will start flashing individual regions, attempting to get new user attentions.
